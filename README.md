Hey! I'm Viral. I code as both a hobby and passion, working on projects ranging from discord bots to minecraft servers and everything in between. I post my work in public repositories when I can for others to find and hopefully use in their projects, no license needed. If you have any questions about my code, feel free to contact me!

## 🏎️ Roblox Jailbreak Utilities
Originally designed for a discord bot, these scripts integrate both Jailbreak & JBValues APIs to generate simple, formatted data for each item in the game including its value and trading statistics. These scripts will function without update for as long as the game continues to update its API.
* [View the repository here!](https://github.com/ignViralX/JailbreakUtilities/tree/main)
* All code is unlicensed and free for anyone to use.
* Last updated **May 11th, 2025**.
